    "description": "You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.\n\nYou want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.\n\nReturn the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.\nNote that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.\n\nConstraints:\n- 1 <= prices.length <= 10^5\n- 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4",
